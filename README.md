# The assignment:

Create an Angular app that is capable of importing the attached csv-file and visualize it on the screen

## Keep in mind the following:
1. I should be able to select this file from my computer and see the results on screen
2. I should be able to filter the results based on minimal issue count
3. Act as if this code is meant to be production code for the Rabobank

# CsvFileReader

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Improvements

1. Filtering logic needs to be implemented.
2. UI should be improved
3. Test code
